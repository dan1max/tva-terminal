        <h1>About the TVA</h1>
        
        <p>The Time Variance Authority stands as the ultimate authority on temporal matters, existing outside of time itself at the End of Time. Our sacred duty is to preserve the proper flow of time and maintain the integrity of the Sacred Timeline.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>To monitor, protect, and preserve the Sacred Timeline from dangerous variants and branching timelines that threaten the stability of all existence. We operate with absolute authority across all temporal dimensions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>History & Foundation</h2>
        <p>Founded at the End of Time by the Time-Keepers, the TVA has existed since before time had meaning. Our organization transcends conventional reality, operating from a nexus point that exists simultaneously at all points in time and none.</p>

        <p>The Time-Keepers, three omniscient entities who oversee all of time, created the TVA after the great Multiversal War threatened to destroy all of existence. They reorganized the multiverse into a single Sacred Timeline and established the TVA to ensure it would never branch again.</p>

        <h2>Organizational Structure</h2>
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>The Time-Keepers</h3>
                <p>The supreme beings who oversee all of time. They created the Sacred Timeline and the TVA to protect it. All TVA authority derives from their divine mandate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Judges</h3>
                <p>Senior officials who preside over variant trials and make critical decisions about pruning and resetting timelines. They interpret the will of the Time-Keepers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Minutemen</h3>
                <p>Elite field agents who respond to nexus events, apprehend variants, and reset branched timelines. They are the front line of temporal defense.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Analysts</h3>
                <p>Specialists who monitor the timeline, detect anomalies, and coordinate responses to temporal threats. They process all variant cases.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Hunters</h3>
                <p>Senior field operatives who track dangerous variants across multiple timelines and coordinate complex temporal operations.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Support Staff</h3>
                <p>The backbone of TVA operations, managing records, evidence, and administrative functions that keep the organization running smoothly.</p>

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Sacred Timeline must be preserved at all costs</li>
            <li>All variants represent potential threats to temporal stability</li>
            <li>Nexus events must be pruned before they cause irreparable branching</li>
            <li>The Time-Keepers' will is absolute and infallible</li>
            <li>Free will ends where the Sacred Timeline begins</li>
            <li>For All Time. Always.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Technology & Capabilities</h3>
            <p>The TVA operates with technology far beyond that of any single timeline. Our TemPads allow agents to travel instantly to any point in time, our reset charges can prune entire timeline branches, and our temporal sensors detect the slightest deviation from the Sacred Timeline's designated path.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Join the TVA</h2>
        <p>All TVA employees are variants who were removed from the timeline and given a higher purpose. If you believe you have what it takes to protect all of time, your opportunity may come when you least expect it. The TVA is always watching, always vigilant.</p>
